Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /usr/bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	collect_files
	1

        ls database/*fna > list.txt

Error in rule collect_files:
    jobid: 0
    output: list.txt
    shell:
        
        ls database/*fna > list.txt
        
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job collect_files since they might be corrupted:
list.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
